# DataScienceEnd2End_EmployeeAttrition
This project is to apply complete end to end data science steps on IBM Employee data set. Focus will be mainly on Imbalanced Classification Problems and also in exploring several machine learning algorithm and optimize them. 

## Code
 - src/data/get_processed_data.py : This is a single reexecutable program to process the raw data. 
 - src/data/get_raw_data.py: This is the program to extract the data from kaggle website.
 - src/models/machine_learning_api.py : This the Machine learning API I have written to run my model. This API takes data as       input and gives the prediction back to the user. 
 -/models/lr_model.pkl - This the persistence model for logical regression created, so that we do not have to train our program everytime we call it. 
 -/models/lr_scaler.pkl - This is persistence model for the scaler created so that we do not have to apply normalization and standardisation on training data everytime we call the program. 
 -/notebooks - It contains jupyter notebooks for all the analysis and learnings I did during this implementation.
